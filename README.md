# UTCDatetime

A VFP extension to handle UTC dates and time, including historical points in time, and conversion from and to local time in any time zone.

It uses the iCal4VFP library and requires Web access to TzURL data.

## Installation

Just `DO utc.app` (located in the `bin` folder). This will instantiate a UTCDatetime object named `UTC` that is added to `_Screen`. The object will be always in scope and it can be referenced from anywhere (the command window, programs, methods, menus, reports, SQL parameters, and so on).

## PEM

### Methods

----------

#### Now() AS Datetime

Returns the current UTC time (as indicated by the system's clock).

----------

#### DefTimezone (Source AS String)

Sets the source from time zone definition. `m.Source = "Web"` loads always from TzURL; `= "Local"` loads from local copy, when available; otherwise, from local copy if not older than 30 days (default), from TzURL in other cases.

----------

#### SetTimezone ([TzID AS String]) AS Boolean

Sets the time zone. A time zone is identified by its IANA code (for instance, `"America/New_York"`, or `"Etc/GMT+3"`. This will be the default time zone. Passing no `m.TZID` will set the time zone to UTC. 

----------

#### LoadTimezone (TzID AS String) AS Boolean

Loads a time zone definition. Prefetches a definition that will be ready to be used when required.

----------

#### UTCTime ([LocalTime AS Datetime] [, TZID AS String]) AS Datetime

Returns the UTC time for a given local time at a given time zone. `m.LocalTime` defaults to `DATETIME()`; if no `m.TZID` is passed, the default time zone will be used instead.

----------

#### LocalTime ([UTCTime AS Datetime] [, TZID AS String]) AS Datetime

Returns the local time for a given UTC time at a given time zone. `m.UTCTime` defaults to `This.Now()`; if no `m.TZID` is passed, the default time zone will be used instead.

----------

#### TTOC (LocalTime AS Datetime[, TZIDorOffset AS StringOrInteger[, Options AS Integer]]) AS String

Formats a local time according to ISO8601 `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM`, or RFC2822 `Wkd, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS±HHMM`.

If no `m.TZIDorOffset` is given, the default time zone will be used instead.

If `m.TZIDorOffset` is a TZID, the UTC offset will be calculated for the given date and time; otherwise, the offset will be used for the time format.

Flags `m.Options` BITAND(0x001) = display the time name after the time formatted string (for instance, CET or WET); BITAND(0x0002) = do not display time name when TzURL defines it as an offset (for instance, -03 instead of BRT).

`BITAND(m.Options, 0xC000)` designates the output format: 0x0000 for ISO8601, 0x4000 for RFC2822. 

----------

#### CTOT (UTCTimeString AS String) AS Datetime

Returns the UTC datetime corresponding to ISO8601 `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM`, or RFC2822 `Wkd, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS±HHMM`. 

----------

#### GetUTCOffset ([LocalTime AS Datetime] [, TZID AS String]) AS Integer

Returns the UTC offset observed at a given date in a given time zone. `m.LocalTime` defaults to `DATETIME()`; if no `m.TZID` is passed, the default time zone is used instead.

----------

#### GetTimeDifference (Time1 AS Datetime, TZID1 AS String, Time2 AS Datetime, TZID2 AS String) AS Number
Returns the time difference in seconds between two datetimes that may be, or may not be in the same time zone. The result can be read as "how time2 compares to time1" (if greater than zero, time2 occurs after time1; if less than zero time2 occurs before time1; if equal to zero, both datetimes occur at the same time).

To calculate a duration of an event, set time1 as the beginning of the event, and time2 as the end.

### Properties

----------

#### Current = .F.

Set it to `.T.` for recent, current, or future datetimes: the historical definitions of a time zone are ignored, and only the current one is used.

----------

#### TimeName = ""

The time name for the last calculated time (for instance, "EDT" or "EST").

## Using

### Examples

Use these examples as they are or take them as a model and experiment with your own data and timezone.

#### Get the current UTC and local times for two cities in the USA

```foxpro
LOCAL m.UTCTime AS Datetime

m.UTCTime = _Screen.UTC.Now()

? "UTC:", m.UTCTime
? "In New York:", _Screen.UTC.LocalTime(m.UTCTime, "America/New_York")
? "In Los Angeles:", _Screen.UTC.LocalTime(m.UTCTime, "America/Los_Angeles")
```

#### Calculate the duration of international flights

```foxpro
